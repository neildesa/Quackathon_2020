# Roadmap

1. Create empty room - no obstacles, no doors?

2. Add blob character - just a circle, no art

3. Create movement - left right up down 

4. Add doors

5. Doors lead to new room

6. Add obstacles

7. Procedurally place obstacles

8. Add an enemy in a room -
	- doesn't do anything
	- then follows you around
	- then can hit you
	
9. Randomly generate enemy specifics - legs->speed,mvmtType; body->hitbox,health; head->tbd; weapon->range

10. Add more
	
	
11. Going back to old doors goes to empty rooms - should be saved??
